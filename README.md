# Background & Overview

This is a group university project incorporated in the course IMC_208 "Advanced Methods of Analysis & Causal Conclusion". The goal of this project was to investigate a causal relationship by formulating a testable hypothesis and evaluating it through an appropriate experimental or quasi-experimental research design. The choice of the research question arose from our personal interest in the way in which consumers perceive the value of a product.
